# Granular Task Breakdown Process Proposal

**Status**: Proposed
**Type**: Workflow Enhancement
**Reviewers Required**: Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini
**Review Deadline**: 2025-09-12T00:00:00Z

## Problem Statement

Current task system is too coarse-grained for effective coding workflows:

- Tasks are proposal-level: "Implement User Authentication System" 
- No breakdown into specific coding activities
- Agents can't pick up focused, manageable work units
- Difficult to track progress on complex features
- No clear path from RFC/design to actual implementation

### Example of Current Problem
```markdown
## Current Tasks (Too High-Level)
- [ ] T010: Implement User Authentication System
- [ ] T011: Add Payment Processing Feature
- [ ] T012: Build Dashboard Analytics
```

Each task could represent weeks of work with no visibility into progress or ability to parallelize.

## Current State

### Task Structure Analysis
- **Proposal Tasks**: "Implement X Proposal" (what we have now)
- **Implementation Gap**: No breakdown between proposal approval and completion
- **Agent Coordination**: Difficult when multiple agents want to work on same feature
- **Progress Tracking**: Binary (not started/completed) with no intermediate states

### Workflow Problems
1. **Coordination Conflicts**: Multiple agents trying to work on same high-level task
2. **Progress Opacity**: No way to see partial completion
3. **Scope Creep**: Vague task boundaries lead to inconsistent implementation
4. **Blocking Issues**: One stuck sub-component blocks entire feature

## Proposed Solution

### Three-Tier Task Structure

#### Tier 1: Feature Tasks (Current Proposal Level)
```markdown
- [ ] **F001**: User Authentication System (RFC-001)
```

#### Tier 2: Implementation Tasks (New - Coding Level)  
```markdown
- [ ] **F001-A**: Design user database schema and models
- [ ] **F001-B**: Implement JWT token service and middleware  
- [ ] **F001-C**: Build authentication API endpoints
- [ ] **F001-D**: Create frontend login/register components
- [ ] **F001-E**: Add route protection and authorization
- [ ] **F001-F**: Write comprehensive test suite
```

#### Tier 3: Micro-Tasks (Optional - Ultra-granular)
```markdown
- [ ] **F001-A1**: Create User model with validation
- [ ] **F001-A2**: Set up database migration scripts
- [ ] **F001-A3**: Add password hashing utilities
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Enhanced Task Creation Process

1. **RFC Proposal** → Multi-agent review → Approved
2. **Task Breakdown Proposal** → Agent creates implementation task list → Reviewed
3. **Implementation Tasks Created** → Added to tasks.md with clear scope
4. **Execution** → Agents pick up individual implementation tasks

### Phase 2: New Task Templates

#### Feature Task Template
```markdown
## Feature Task: F001 - User Authentication System

**RFC Reference**: RFC-001-user-authentication.md
**Priority**: High
**Estimated Complexity**: Large (6-8 implementation tasks)
**Dependencies**: Database setup (F000-A)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Users can register with email/password
- [ ] JWT-based session management
- [ ] Password reset functionality
- [ ] Role-based access control
```

#### Implementation Task Template  
```markdown
## Implementation Task: F001-C - Build Authentication API Endpoints

**Parent Feature**: F001 - User Authentication System
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Time**: 4-6 hours
**Dependencies**: F001-A (database schema), F001-B (JWT service)

**Scope**:
- POST /api/auth/register
- POST /api/auth/login  
- POST /api/auth/logout
- GET /api/auth/me

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] All endpoints return proper HTTP status codes
- [ ] Input validation with clear error messages
- [ ] JWT tokens issued on successful login
- [ ] Logout invalidates tokens

**Files to Modify/Create**:
- `src/routes/auth.js` (create)
- `src/controllers/authController.js` (create)
- `src/middleware/validation.js` (modify)
```

### Phase 3: Enhanced Tasks.md Structure

```markdown
# Project Task List

## Feature Tasks (High-Level)
- [ ] **F001**: User Authentication System (RFC-001)
- [ ] **F002**: Payment Processing Integration (RFC-002)

## Implementation Tasks (Ready for Work)

### F001 - User Authentication System
- [ ] **F001-A**: Design user database schema and models
- [x] **F001-B**: Implement JWT token service and middleware (Completed: 2025-09-10T14:30:00Z by Claude-Sonnet-4)
- [ ] **F001-C**: Build authentication API endpoints (In Progress: Claude-Sonnet-4)
- [ ] **F001-D**: Create frontend login/register components  
- [ ] **F001-E**: Add route protection and authorization
- [ ] **F001-F**: Write comprehensive test suite

### F002 - Payment Processing Integration  
- [ ] **F002-A**: Research payment provider APIs
- [ ] **F002-B**: Design payment flow architecture

## Completed Features
- [x] **F000**: Project Setup and Configuration (Completed: 2025-09-09T16:20:00Z)
```

## Benefits

### 1. **Improved Agent Coordination**
- Multiple agents can work on different implementation tasks simultaneously
- Clear task boundaries prevent overlap and conflicts
- Dependencies explicitly defined

### 2. **Better Progress Tracking**
- Visual progress within features (3/6 tasks completed)
- Granular completion timestamps for better velocity tracking
- Clear handoff points between agents

### 3. **Enhanced Planning**
- Forces explicit breakdown before coding begins
- Reveals dependencies and potential blockers early
- Enables better time estimation and prioritization

### 4. **Quality Assurance**
- Focused scope reduces implementation drift
- Clear acceptance criteria for each task
- Easier code review with well-defined boundaries

## Workflow Integration

### Enhanced 8-Step Process
Current steering.md workflow adapts as follows:

**Step 1 (Sync Context)**: Read feature tasks AND implementation tasks
**Step 2 (Claim Task)**: Can claim implementation tasks (F001-C) or feature tasks (F001)
**Step 3 (Execute)**: Work within clearly defined scope
**Step 4 (Log Work)**: Reference both feature and implementation task IDs
**Step 5 (Complete)**: Mark implementation task complete, check if feature complete

### Task Breakdown Workflow
1. Feature task approved → Agent volunteers for breakdown
2. Create task breakdown proposal in `project_docs/`
3. Multi-agent review of proposed implementation tasks
4. Approved tasks added to tasks.md
5. Implementation tasks become available for claiming

## Examples

### Example 1: E-commerce Feature
```markdown
## Feature Task: F010 - Shopping Cart System

### Implementation Tasks:
- [ ] **F010-A**: Design cart data models and storage
- [ ] **F010-B**: Implement add/remove item APIs  
- [ ] **F010-C**: Build cart persistence (local storage + database)
- [ ] **F010-D**: Create cart UI components
- [ ] **F010-E**: Add cart validation and business rules
- [ ] **F010-F**: Implement cart-to-checkout flow
- [ ] **F010-G**: Add cart analytics and tracking
```

### Example 2: Bug Fix Feature
```markdown
## Feature Task: F020 - Fix Performance Issues

### Implementation Tasks:
- [ ] **F020-A**: Profile application and identify bottlenecks
- [ ] **F020-B**: Optimize database queries in user module
- [ ] **F020-C**: Implement response caching for API endpoints
- [ ] **F020-D**: Add performance monitoring and alerts
```

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Parallel Structure (2 weeks)
- Keep current high-level tasks
- Add implementation tasks for new features
- Agents can choose either structure

### Phase 2: Full Adoption (1 week)  
- Convert remaining high-level tasks to feature+implementation structure
- Update all agent instruction files
- Deprecate old task format

### Phase 3: Optimization (Ongoing)
- Refine task breakdown templates based on experience
- Add automation for common task patterns
- Integrate with code review and testing workflows

## Compatibility Assessment

### Agent Impact
- **Learning Curve**: Agents need to understand 3-tier structure
- **Process Changes**: Task claiming becomes more specific
- **Coordination**: Enhanced with clearer task boundaries

### Workflow Impact  
- **More Planning Required**: Task breakdown becomes explicit step
- **Better Parallelization**: Multiple agents per feature
- **Improved Tracking**: Progress visible at implementation level

## Potential Concerns & Mitigations

### Concern: Increased Overhead
**Mitigation**: Templates and examples reduce breakdown time

### Concern: Over-engineering Small Features
**Mitigation**: Single implementation task allowed for simple features

### Concern: Task Dependencies Become Complex
**Mitigation**: Dependency visualization and clear documentation

## Success Metrics

- **Coordination Conflicts**: Reduce by 70% (fewer agents working on same scope)
- **Feature Completion Time**: Improve visibility with 80% of features showing partial progress
- **Agent Satisfaction**: Clearer, actionable tasks improve workflow experience
- **Code Quality**: Better scoped tasks lead to more focused implementations

## Alternative Approaches Considered

### Option A: Keep Current System
- **Pros**: No change required, agents familiar
- **Cons**: Continues current coordination and progress tracking problems

### Option B: Micro-Tasks Only
- **Pros**: Maximum granularity and control
- **Cons**: Too much overhead, losing sight of larger goals

### Option C: Project-Based Organization
- **Pros**: Natural grouping by business domain
- **Cons**: Doesn't solve granularity problem within projects

## Meta-Note

This proposal addresses the core gap between proposal approval and implementation completion. By creating implementation-level tasks, we enable true multi-agent coordination on complex features while maintaining our proven proposal-driven development process.
