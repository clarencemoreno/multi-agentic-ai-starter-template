# Enterprise Pull Request Workflow Proposal

## Problem Statement
The current workflow allows direct merges to main branch, which conflicts with enterprise development standards. Enterprise developers expect mandatory PR creation, code review, and approval gates - practices required for compliance, security, and quality assurance in corporate environments.

Our target audience (enterprise developers) will not adopt a system that bypasses industry-standard development practices.

## Current State
**Current steering.md workflow (7 steps):**
1. Sync Context
2. Claim Task  
3. Execute Task
4. Log Your Work
5. Complete Task
6. Finalize (includes git push)
7. Validation

**Issues:**
- No PR creation requirement
- Direct merges to main allowed
- No mandatory code review
- Missing approval gates
- Doesn't align with enterprise compliance requirements

## Proposed Solution

### Update Steering.md to 8-Step Enterprise Workflow

**Enhanced Steps 6-8:**

```markdown
6. **Finalize**
   - Stage changes: `git add [modified files]`
   - Commit with descriptive message: `git commit -m "T001: Implemented feature X"`
   - Push branch to remote: `git push -u origin [branch-name]`
   - Update TASKS.md and changelog.md to reflect completion

7. **Create Pull Request**
   - Create PR from feature branch to main
   - Include in PR description:
     - Task ID(s) and summary
     - Agent(s) involved  
     - Links to relevant changelog entries
     - Checklist of changes made
   - Add reviewers (other agents or human maintainers)
   - Set appropriate labels and milestones

8. **Validation & Approval**
   - Confirm PR created successfully
   - Verify all required checks pass (if CI/CD configured)
   - Check if workflow changes require version bump in steering.md
   - Await reviewer approval before merge
   - **Do not merge directly to main without approval**
```

### Updated CONTRIBUTING.md Sections

**Version Control Guidelines:**
```markdown
## Enterprise Development Standards

### Mandatory Pull Request Process
1. All changes must go through feature branches
2. No direct commits to main branch allowed
3. Pull requests required for all merges
4. Minimum one approval required (human or designated agent)
5. CI/CD checks must pass before merge

### Pull Request Requirements
- Descriptive title with task ID
- Detailed description of changes
- Link to related issues/tasks
- Appropriate reviewers assigned
- All validation checks completed
```

### Agent-Specific Updates

**Add to all agent instruction files:**
```markdown
## Enterprise Compliance
- Never merge directly to main branch
- Always create pull requests for review
- Wait for approval before merging
- Follow corporate development standards
- Maintain audit trail through PR process
```

## Benefits

### For Enterprise Adoption
- **Compliance ready** - Meets corporate development standards
- **Security gates** - Prevents unauthorized direct commits
- **Quality assurance** - Mandatory code review process
- **Audit trails** - Complete history of who approved what
- **Risk management** - Easy rollback and change tracking

### For Multi-Agent Coordination  
- **Structured handoffs** - Clear PR-based coordination
- **Review checkpoints** - Agents can review each other's work
- **Conflict prevention** - PR process prevents simultaneous work
- **Documentation** - PR descriptions document agent reasoning

### For Project Management
- **Visibility** - All changes visible in PR interface
- **Discussion** - PR comments enable agent collaboration
- **Integration** - Works with enterprise CI/CD systems
- **Reporting** - PR metrics for project tracking

## Implementation Requirements

1. **Update steering.md** with 8-step enterprise workflow
2. **Enhance CONTRIBUTING.md** with PR requirements
3. **Update all agent instruction files** with enterprise compliance
4. **Add PR templates** to `.github/` directory (optional)
5. **Document approval process** for different change types

## Target Audience Alignment

**Enterprise Developers Expect:**
- ✅ Feature branch workflow
- ✅ Mandatory code review
- ✅ Approval gates
- ✅ No direct main commits
- ✅ Audit trails
- ✅ Integration with existing tools

**Lone Wolf Developers (Not Target):**
- ❌ Would find process cumbersome
- ❌ Prefer direct commits
- ❌ Avoid formal reviews
- ❌ Skip approval processes

## Compatibility
Maintains all existing coordination benefits while adding enterprise-grade development practices. Backward compatible for teams that want simpler workflows but enables enterprise adoption.

## Version Impact
This represents a **Minor Version (v1.3)** enhancement:
- Improves existing workflow steps
- Adds enterprise capabilities
- Maintains backward compatibility
- No breaking changes to core coordination
