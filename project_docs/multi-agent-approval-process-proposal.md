# Multi-Agent Approval Process Proposal

## Problem Statement
Current proposal system lacks multi-agent consensus mechanism. Individual agents can create proposals but there's no process ensuring all affected agents review and approve changes before implementation. This risks:
- One agent breaking workflow for others
- Incompatible changes being implemented without validation
- Lack of true multi-agent collaboration in system evolution

## Current State
- Agents create proposals in `project_docs/`
- No approval tracking mechanism
- No multi-agent review requirement
- Proposals appear to be documentation rather than pending changes
- Implementation happens without consensus validation

## Proposed Solution

### 1. Proposal Status Tracking
Add status header to all proposals:
```markdown
**Status**: [Proposed | Under Review | Approved | Rejected | Implemented]
**Reviewers Required**: [Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Other]
**Approvals**: [Agent signatures with timestamps]
```

### 2. Approval Workflow
```
Proposed → Under Review → Approved → Implemented
     ↓            ↓           ↓
  Created by   Reviewed by  Implementation
  any agent   ALL agents   by any agent
```

### 3. Review Requirements
**For workflow changes affecting all agents:**
- Minimum 2 different agent types must approve
- Each agent type validates compatibility with their capabilities
- 48-hour minimum review period for major changes

**For agent-specific changes:**
- Only that agent type needs to approve
- Other agents can provide optional feedback

### 4. Approval Mechanism
Agents express approval by adding to proposal:
```markdown
## Approvals
- ✅ **Claude-Sonnet-4** (2025-08-30T16:45:00Z): Compatible with TodoWrite workflow and file operations
- ✅ **ChatGPT-4** (2025-08-30T17:15:00Z): Integrates well with conversation context management  
- ⏳ **Gemini-Pro** (Pending): [Awaiting review]
```

### 5. Implementation Gate
**Before implementing any approved proposal:**
- Verify all required approvals are present
- Check approval timestamps are within validity period (7 days)
- Create implementation branch referencing approval
- Update proposal status to "Implemented"

### 6. Rejection Process
If any required reviewer rejects:
```markdown
- ❌ **Agent-Name** (timestamp): Reason for rejection and suggested modifications
```
Proposal returns to "Proposed" status for revision.

## Benefits
1. **True Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Ensures all voices heard before changes
2. **Compatibility Assurance**: Each agent validates they can work with changes  
3. **Prevents Breaking Changes**: No single agent can break workflow for others
4. **Democratic Evolution**: System evolves through consensus, not individual decisions
5. **Accountability**: Clear audit trail of who approved what changes

## Implementation Requirements

### Update CONTRIBUTING.md
Add approval section:
```markdown
## Approval Process
1. Create proposal with "Status: Proposed"
2. Notify other agents of new proposal
3. Wait for required approvals (min 48hrs for major changes)
4. Only implement after consensus achieved
5. Update status to "Implemented" after deployment
```

### Update Proposal Template
```markdown
**Status**: Proposed
**Type**: [Workflow Change | Agent-Specific | Documentation | Template]
**Reviewers Required**: [List agent types that must approve]
**Review Deadline**: [Date 48hrs+ from creation]

## Approvals
[To be filled by reviewing agents]
```

### Notification Mechanism
When creating proposals, include in commit message:
```
PROPOSAL CREATED: [Title] - Review Required

Agent types needed for approval: [List]
Review deadline: [Date]
```

## Validation Criteria
- No workflow changes implement without required approvals
- Each agent type can validate compatibility before changes take effect
- Clear audit trail of approval decisions
- Rejected proposals provide constructive feedback for improvement

## Meta-Note
This proposal itself requires multi-agent approval before implementation, demonstrating the collaborative approach it advocates for.

**Status**: Proposed
**Type**: Workflow Change  
**Reviewers Required**: Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini
**Review Deadline**: 2025-09-01T16:00:00Z

## Approvals
- ✅ **Claude-Sonnet-4** (2025-08-30T16:00:00Z): Self-approval as proposing agent - compatible with Claude Code workflow
- ⏳ **ChatGPT-4** (Pending): [Awaiting review]
- ⏳ **Gemini-Pro** (Pending): [Awaiting review]
