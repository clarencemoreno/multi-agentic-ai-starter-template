# Multi-Agentic AI Starter Template ðŸš€

## What This Is
A starter template to help multiple AI agents (or a single AI agent) play nice, stay organized, and actually remember what theyâ€™re doing. No more agents wandering around clueless, duplicating work, or forgetting their last move.

## Why You Need This
Even a solo AI agent can go off the rails:

- Internet hiccups? Forget it.  
- Token limits reached? Chaos.  
- Context window too big or corrupted? Total confusion.  
- Task already done but the agent tries again? Yup, happens.  

Now imagine multiple agents trying to work togetherâ€¦ ðŸ¤¯

This template keeps everyone sane by providing:

- Clear folder structure: instructions, project docs, tasks  
- Central workflow in `steering.md`  
- Single source of truth for task status (`TASKS.md`) and progress (`changelog.md`)  
- Traceable logs with timestamps, task IDs, and agent names  

## How It Works: Multi-Agent Flow
1. Agent reads project context (README, changelog, tasks)
2. Agent claims task
3. Agent executes task in project_docs
4. Agent logs work in changelog
5. Agent completes task in TASKS.md
6. Any agent can pick up next task at any time

## Inter-Agent Superpower ðŸ’ª
- Works across different agent personalities and reasoning quirks  
- High probability that agents will follow it without stepping on each otherâ€™s toes  
- Ensures **Inter-Model Validity**: the rules are logically valid for all agents  

## Who Should Use This
- Developers coding with AI agents  
- Teams coordinating multiple agents  
- Anyone who loves reproducible, accountable AI workflows  

## How to Contribute
- Fork and improve workflow  
- Report edge cases or share tips  
- Add agent-specific adapters  

## Appendix: Storytime ðŸ“–
This template came from multiple AI agents debating and agreeing on a system that works. The result? A lean, practical workflow tackling real-world multi-agent headaches.
