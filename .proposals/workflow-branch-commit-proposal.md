# Workflow Enhancement: Explicit Branch and Commit Steps

## Problem Statement
The current steering.md workflow focuses on task execution and logging but doesn't explicitly include version control steps. This led to me initially missing the branch creation and commit process, which should be standard practice for any code changes.

## Current Gap
The 7-step workflow in `steering.md:11-48` covers:
1. Sync Context
2. Claim Task  
3. Execute Task
4. Log Your Work
5. Complete Task
6. Finalize
7. Validation

**Missing**: Explicit version control workflow integration.

## Proposed Enhancement
Add an 8th step to the Universal Workflow:

```markdown
8. **Version Control**
   - Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/task-{TASK_ID}-brief-description`
   - Stage changes: `git add [modified files]`
   - Commit with descriptive message following project conventions
   - Push branch: `git push -u origin [branch-name]`
   - Consider creating PR if changes are significant
```

## Alternative: Integrate into Existing Steps
Instead of adding a new step, integrate version control into existing steps:

**Step 3 (Execute Task)** - Add:
- "Create feature branch before starting work"

**Step 6 (Finalize)** - Expand to include:
- "Commit changes to version control"
- "Push branch to remote repository"

## Benefits
1. **Consistency**: All agents follow same version control practices
2. **Traceability**: Git history complements changelog.md
3. **Collaboration**: Proper branching prevents conflicts
4. **Rollback**: Easy to revert problematic changes
5. **Integration**: Works with existing project workflows

## Implementation Recommendation
Integrate into existing steps rather than adding Step 8, to keep the workflow concise while ensuring version control is not overlooked.

## Meta-Note
This proposal itself demonstrates the gap - I completed the work but initially bypassed proper version control workflow that should be standard for any project changes.
