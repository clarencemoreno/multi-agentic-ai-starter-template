# Flow Improvements Proposal

## Overview
Recommendations to improve the multi-agent coordination workflow based on analysis of potential confusion points in the current system.

## Proposed Improvements

### 1. Task Claiming Lock Mechanism
**Problem**: No clear locking mechanism prevents two agents from claiming the same task simultaneously.

**Solution**: 
- Include timestamp when moving task to "In Progress"
- Format: `- [x] **T001**: Task description (Claimed: 2025-08-30T15:30:00Z by Claude-Sonnet-4)`
- Other agents must check claim timestamp before attempting to claim

### 2. Timezone Handling Specification
**Problem**: UTC format required but timezone conversion guidance missing.

**Solution**:
- Add timezone conversion examples to steering.md
- Specify that all timestamps must be in UTC
- Provide conversion guidance for agents in different timezones

### 3. Template Files Creation
**Problem**: Step 1 mentions "create using templates" but no templates provided.

**Solution**:
- Create template files in `templates/` directory
- Include: `TASKS.md.template`, `changelog.md.template`, `README.md.template`
- Reference these in steering.md step 1

### 4. Completion Announcement Clarification
**Problem**: "Announce completion to system or user" is vague.

**Solution**:
- Define specific output format: `TASK_COMPLETED: T001 - [Brief summary]`
- Specify when to announce (always) vs when to wait for user prompt

### 5. Enhanced Conflict Resolution
**Problem**: "Newer entries take precedence" but "close timestamps (<1 hour)" creates ambiguity.

**Solution**:
- Priority order: Task claim timestamp > changelog timestamp > agent priority
- Define agent priority system (e.g., alphabetical by model name)
- Clear escalation path for unresolvable conflicts

## Implementation Priority
1. Task claiming lock mechanism (High - prevents work duplication)
2. Template files creation (High - enables proper initialization)
3. Timezone handling (Medium - improves consistency)
4. Completion announcements (Medium - improves user experience)
5. Enhanced conflict resolution (Low - edge case handling)

## Backward Compatibility
All proposed changes maintain compatibility with existing workflow. Changes are additive rather than breaking.
